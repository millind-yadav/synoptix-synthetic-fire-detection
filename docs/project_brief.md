# Optimising Synthetic Data Use in AI for Industrial Fire Detection 

**Background:**

Early fire detection is critical in manufacturing sites where flammable materials and complex machinery are common. AI-powered fire detection systems require large, diverse datasets to generalise well in high-risk environments, however acquiring real-world fire footage in manufacturing settings is both scarce and dangerous. Synthetic data offers a scalable, safe alternative by simulating various fire scenarios through synthetic means. This project aims to augment real datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of supplementing limited real world datasets with synthetic data. 

**Approach:**

This project investigates the use of synthetic data in training AI models for fire detection within manufacturing environments. The aim is to identify optimal data compositions between synthetic and data to improve performance in detecting fires accurately and early. Beyond detection, the AI system must support timely mitigation such as activating alarms, shutting down machinery or notifying emergency response systems.

**Outcomes:**

- **An analysis on the effectiveness of synthetic data and real data sources for fire detection AI.**

- **Produce an AI algorithm capable of image classification specifically to Fire.**

- **Optimise AI through synthetic data training**

- Determine the optimal synthetic to real data ratio for greatest model performance. 

- **Validate system effectiveness in detecting fires and initiating timely responses**

- **Considerations into mitigation strategies for AI triggered response protocols**

**Deliverables:** Presentation; Visualisations (e.g. infographics, videos); Report on findings; AI Model.
